\section{Introduction}

The famous saying of John von Neumann: {\it ``With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk''} is a perhaps just a humorous version of Ockham's razor: 
{\it``Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity''}, but illustrates very well a principle that is not often followed by researchers, especially when building predictive models. 
This is true also in the literature of probabilistic sports predictions, particularly regarding models devoted to football predictions.

Bothered by such concerns, we tried to answer the following question: is it possible, using a simple probabilistic model, to predict results of football matches better than more sophisticated or complex models?
To answer this question we compared two sophisticated models with simple multinomial-Dirichlet models that consider only the number of matches won, drawn or lost by each team as inputs.
The models were tested for the second round of the Brazilian football championships of first and second divisions and compared using standard metrics or scoring rules (Brier, logarithmic and spherical).
We also used other criteria such as the proportion of matches that were predicted ``correctly'' by each model and a measure of calibration, both explained in detail below.
According to the adopted criteria, the simple models showed a predictive performance quite similar to the complex ones.

The complex models used here as benchmarks publish their predictions on Internet websites for every matchday and are treated by us as black-box models, since we were not interested in how they were built or the assumptions on which they are based.
We know that\footnote{One of the authors is responsible for one of these models and the other was described in a dissertation.} both models are based on the bivariate Poisson or Holgate distribution, being able to predict the final score of a match given explanatory variables.
\footnote{For more details see \cite{arruda2000}.}
Simulating the model a given number of times, the estimated probability that, for instance, the home team will win, draw or loose is the proportion of times the simulated score favors the home team, were equal or favors the visiting team, respectively.
Therefore, knowing that both model are based on an elaborate parametric model, they are suitable for the comparison we are proposing: simple versus complex models.

There are several ways to score or classify predictions of categorical events like football matches, that assume one out of three possible modes.
See \cite{constantinou} for a brief survey of such measures applied to football.
We decided to, primarily, score the previsions for each match in terms of its distance from the truth, i.e. the verified event, once it has occurred, and chose the most used distances in the literature: Brier (\cite{brier1950}), logarithmic and spherical.
The total inaccuracy of each model is then defined as the sum of the point-wise scores of all its previsions.

This paper is organized as follows.
Section 1 describes the proposed models, Section 2 presents the scoring rules and criteria used in this work to classify the models.
Section 3 reports the performance of the models predicting 380 matches comprising the second half of Brazilian championships of first and second divisions.
In Section 4 we discuss the results and Section 5 closes with some remarks and proposals for future research.

\subsection{Multinomial-Dirichlet}

Considering team $A$: the result of its next match may be considered a categorical random quantity (r.q.) that may assume only three modes; win ($W$), draw ($D$) or loss ($L$).

If we denote the probability of $W$, by $\theta_1$, of $D$ by $\theta_2$ and of $L$ by $\theta_3=1-\theta_1-\theta_2$ where $\theta_1+\theta_2\leq 1$.

The p.m.f of such r.q. is

\[
P(X=x|\theta)=\theta_1^{I(x=W)}\theta_2^{I(x=D)}(1-\theta_1-\theta_2)^{I(x=L)}
\]

\noindent
where $\mathcal{X}=\{W,D,L\}$ and $I(x=i)$ is the indicator function, that takes value 1 if $x$ equals $i= W, D, L$ and 0 otherwise; $\theta=\{(\theta_1,\theta_2)\in\Re^2:\theta_1+\theta_2\leq1 ~ \text{and} ~ \theta_i\geq0 ~ \text{for} ~ i=1, 2\}$

We may also call it multivariate Bernoulli r.q.

Assuming that the matches of team $A$, given $\theta$, are i.i.d. with categorical distribution, the sum of $n$ r.q.'s has multinomial distribution with parameters $\theta$ and $n$.

\[
P(M_1=n_1,M_2=n_2,M_3=n_3|\theta,n)=\]
\[
\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!(n-n_1-n_2)!}\theta_1^{n_1}\theta_2^{n_2}(1-\theta_1-\theta_2)^{n-n_1-n_2}
\]

when $n_1+n_2+n_3=n$ and 0 otherwise, for non-negative integers $n_1$, $n_2$ and $n_3$.

$n_1$ is the number of matches won, $n_2$ the matches drawn and $n_3=n-n_1-n_2$ the matches lost.

{\bf Summary}: under the given assumptions, the vector of matches won, drawn or lost by some team, has multinomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $\theta$.

We want to compute: 

\[P(X_{n+1}=W|M_1=n_1,M_2=n_2,M_3=n_3)=p_1;\]

\[P(X_{n+1}=D|M_1=n_1,M_2=n_2,M_3=n_3)=p_2;\] and

\[P(X_{n+1}=L|M_1=n_1,M_2=n_2,M_3=n_3)=p_3.\]


Using Bayesian inference these probabilities are easily computed. 


If the prior for $\theta$ is Dirichlet with parameter vector $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3)$, its density function is:

\[
f(\theta|\alpha)=\frac{\Gamma(\alpha_1+\alpha_2+\alpha_3)}{\Gamma(\alpha_1)\Gamma(\alpha_2)\Gamma(\alpha_3)}\theta_1^{\alpha_1-1}\theta_2^{\alpha_2-1}(1-\theta_1-\theta_2)^{\alpha_3-1}
\]

\noindent
for $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\alpha_3 > 0$, then the posterior is Dirichlet with parameters $(n_1+\alpha_1,n_2+\alpha_2,n_3+\alpha_3)$ and it is easy to show that

\[p_1=P(X_{n+1}=W|M_1=n_1,M_2=n_2,M_3=n_3)=\frac{n_1+\alpha_1}{n+\alpha};\]

\noindent
where $n=n_1+n_2+n_3$ and $\alpha=\alpha_1+\alpha_2+\alpha_3$.

Similarly:

\[p_2=P(X_{n+1}=D|M_1=n_1,M_2=n_2,M_3=n_3)=\frac{n_2+\alpha_2}{n+\alpha};\]

\[p_3=P(X_{n+1}=L|M_1=n_1,M_2=n_2,M_3=n_3)=\frac{n_3+\alpha_3}{n+\alpha};\]

Parameters of the prior: (1,1,1), uniform on the simplex.

The green surface is the 2-simplex, i.e. the set of point such that $p_1+p_2+p_3=1$ for non-negative values of $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$.

Now let us look just to the simplex (green triangle).
Its sides have length $\sqrt{2}$ and its height is $\sqrt{6}/2$.
Drawing a similar equilateral triangle with height 1 and sides $2\sqrt{3}/3$, all the points originally represented in the simplex can still be represented.

\[
p_{3a}=\frac{a_3+\alpha_3}{h+\alpha}=\frac{4+1}{9+3}=\frac{5}{12}=0.417\]


What's the probability that Gr\^emio wins: $p_{1h}=0.583$ or $p_{3a}=0.417$?

What's the probability of a draw: $p_{2h}=0.25$ or $p_{2a}=0.333$?

What's the probability that Gr\^emio looses: $p_{3h}=0.167$ or $p_{1a}=0.25$?


Three ways of combining these probabilities are proposed: (I) a mixture with equal weights to both teams; 

\[
\frac{1}{2}\times p_{1h}+\frac{1}{2}\times p_{3a}=\frac{1}{2}\times0.583+\frac{1}{2}\times0.417=0.5
\]

\noindent
is the probability that Gr\^emio wins.


\[
\frac{1}{2}\times p_{2h}+\frac{1}{2}\times p_{2a}=\frac{1}{2}\times0.25+\frac{1}{2}\times0.333=0.2917
\]

\noindent
is the probability of a draw.

\[
\frac{1}{2}\times p_{3h}+\frac{1}{2}\times p_{1a}=\frac{1}{2}\times0.167+\frac{1}{2}\times0.25=0.2083
\]

\noindent
is the probability that Atl\'etico wins.


(II) a mixture with weights (inversely) proportional to the teams rank before the match; 
after 19 matchdays, Gr\^emio was the $6^{th}$ place and Atl\'etico-PR the $11^{th}$:


\[w_1 = \frac{1/6}{1/6+1/11}=0.647 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ w_2 = \frac{1/11}{1/6+1/11}=0.353\]


\[
w_1\times p_{1h}+w_2\times p_{3a}=0.647\times0.583+0.353\times0.417=0.525 (\text{Gr\^emio wins})
\]

\[
w_1\times p_{2h}+w_2\times p_{2a}=0.647\times0.25+0.353\times0.333=0.279 (\text{draw})
\]

\[
w_1\times p_{1h}+w_2\times p_{3a}=0.647\times0.167+0.353\times0.25=0.196 (\text{Atl\'etico wins})
\]
    

(III) combine the counts to generate one prediction: 

$(h_1,h_2,h_3)=(6,2,1)$ and $(a_1,a_2,a_3)=(2,3,4)$ $\Rightarrow$ $(c_1,c_2,c_3)=(10,5,3)$


$c_1=h_1+a_3 \Rightarrow$ number of matches won by Gr\^emio playing home plus matches lost by Atl\'etico playing away.

\[\frac{c_1+\alpha_1}{c+\alpha}=\frac{10+1}{18+3}=0.524
\] 


\[\frac{c_2+\alpha_3}{c+\alpha}=\frac{5+1}{18+3}=0.286
\] 

\[\frac{c_3+\alpha_3}{c+\alpha}=\frac{3+1}{18+3}=0.190
\] 

\noindent
where $c=c_1+c_2+c_3$, $c_2=h_2+a_2$ and $c_3=h_3+a_1$.

Final result: Gr\^emio 1 $\times$ 0 Atl\'etico-PR

\section{Discussion}
%De Finetti was a radical subjectivist and pragmatist about probability and did not believe that it even made sense to talk about credences as being ``accurate'' or ``inaccurate''. 
%Like Ramsey and Savage, he offered pragmatic arguments for probabilism. 
%As a result, de Finetti did not speak of ``measures of inaccuracy'' or ``measures of distance from the truth'': he used the terms ``scoring rule'' and ``loss function''.


%De Finetti used what is called the Brier score, which is just the (squared) Euclidean distance — i.e., the sum of the squared differences between credences and (the 0/1 numerical correlates of) truth values.

It is possible to interpret the score as a numerical measure of how inaccurate was the 
prevision. 

\begin{itemize}

\item Markov chain: the transitions ($W\to D$, $W \to L$ etc) have multinomial distribution;

\item other weights to combine the predictions from both teams;

\item other distances;

\item \dots  
\end{itemize}
